Back in 2016 when we created this, I was in a quest to find out how TinyPNG did their magic. And this was the result - a PNG image compressor with a custom drag and drop file uploader.

## Demo
[https://piper.thimal.me/](https://piper.thimal.me/)

## Setup
### Prerequisites
* pngquant - [https://pngquant.org/](https://pngquant.org/)  
If you're on macOS, use Homebrew to install like so: `brew install pngquant`. You should also be able to find compiled binaries on package managers of Linux distros.

### Deploy
Just serve the files with a web server with PHP 5 support :v:.
